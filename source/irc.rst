About
-----

|IRC_icon| The IRC activity allows you to chat with other Sugar/OLPC users and enthusiasts on the Internet via Internet Relay Chat (IRC).

The activity defaults to a "channel" (akin to a "room") called #sugar on the Freenode network, but you can join one of the many channels available by typing /join #channel, where #channel is the channel name. Like many Free/Open Source projects, Sugar developers frequent this channel, and are happy to help with any Sugar questions and suggestions you may have.

See the Internet Relay Chat page on `this wiki <http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ for a list of Sugar-related channels you can join.
