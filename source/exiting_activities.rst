To quit an Activity using a keyboard shortcut, press and hold the **ctrl** key, and then press the **q** key.

Scratch
-------

There are some "Activities", such as Scratch, that are closed from the "File" menu by selecting "Quit" or "Exit". These activities may require a separate step to save your work by clicking on the "save" or "save as" command or may also be done by clicking the folder icon with a downpointing arrow.

In Scratch, for example, you must go to "File" then "Save As" then give your project a name next to "New Filename" then click "OK".

Etoys
-----

The Etoys Activity closes by clicking a button that has an âœ• within a white disc, rather than the stop sign.
