<p>The designers of the XO laptop designed it for primarily wireless access, so it can work well in developing nations, where it is faster and less expensive to introduce wireless connections than wired ones.</p>
<p>XOs are designed to connect to other XOs using a mesh network. A mesh network allows nearby XO laptops to talk to one another directly (wirelessly) without the need for a traditional Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p>The XO also supports wireless connections for direct Internet connection. Collaboration with others on Activities does not require an Internet connection.</p>
<p>There are different ways to connect to the Internet:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>using a wireless access point such as a WiFi hotspot at a library or coffee shop, or a location that has a wireless router such as your house</li>
<li>using a &#8220;School Server&#8221; provided by your school system</li>
<li>using a USB-to-Ethernet cable that plugs into a cable modem, DSL modem, or local network such as those offered at a home or workplace</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="before-you-connect">
<h2>Before you connect<a class="headerlink" href="#before-you-connect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are going to connect at school or at home, check with your ISP to find out if the network is protected with a password. Your router also has a password which can be found in its documentation. Become familiar with your wireless router settings so that you can troubleshoot the connection if needed. The Troubleshooting chapter offers some assistance.</p>
<p>Check your current connection status as shown in the lower right area on the Frame. If you have connected successfully in the past, the XO &#8220;remembers&#8221; the connection and will connect again in the future.</p>

<p>Go to a location with your XO where you know there is a Wireless Access Point (WAP) nearby.</p>
<p>Find out the network name (or SSID) and its password, if it is secured with a password. The XO refers to this as the Wireless Key.</p>

<p>If you cannot see an Access Point with a name that you recognize, the wireless antenna might be too far away, or the Access Point might not be working properly. For more information, or if you have difficulties getting a network connection, refer to the Troubleshooting chapter.</p>
<p>More information about your XO&#8217;s connection:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your Wireless Access Point has a network name, also called an SSID, that displays in the Neighborhood View. The XO cannot recognize SSIDs that are hidden, which is configured on the access point. Refer to the Troubleshooting chapter for more information about hidden SSIDs.</li>
<li>If you are connected to the Internet, your XO laptop cannot be on the mesh network, and if your XO is on a mesh network, it cannot simultaneously connect wirelessly to the Internet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mesh or AP<a class="headerlink" href="#mesh-or-ap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the XO cannot find an available Internet network point after five minutes of searching, it defaults to Mesh Network 1, which enables your XO laptop to connect to other nearby XO laptops.</li>
<li>Please be patient; it can take your XO up to a minute to find newly visible networks.</li>
<li>Sometimes you&#8217;ll be asked to enter the &#8220;Wireless Key&#8221; again. Enter it again and repeat until your connection is complete.</li>
